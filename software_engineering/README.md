# CS3012 - Software Engineering

## LCA - Lowest Common Ancestor
Project developed in Python 3, using PyCharm. PyCharm keeps committing the project files, 
they're irrelevant to the actual assignment. All tests were ran inside of the PyCharm environment.

In Graph Theory and Computer Science, the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes u and v in 
a tree or a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is the lowest node that has both u and v as descendants,
where we define each node to be a descendant of itself . Thus, the LCA of u and v is the ancestor
of u and v such that it is located farthest from the root

## Part 1 - [Simple LCA](https://github.com/kamilprz/CS3012/tree/master/Simple_LCA)
This part of the assignment, assumes that the graph is structured as a "binary tree". The relevant files for
this part are 'lca.py' and 'test_LCA.py'. They are in the 'Simple_LCA' folder.

## Part 2 - [LCA for Directed Acyclic Graphs](https://github.com/kamilprz/CS3012/tree/master/DAG_LCA)
In mathematics, particularly graph theory, and computer science, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of finitely many vertices and 
edges, with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that there is no way to start at any vertex
v and follow a consistently-directed sequence of edges that eventually loops back to v again. Equivalently, 
a DAG is a directed graph that has a topological ordering, a sequence of the vertices such that every edge 
is directed from earlier to later in the sequence.

This part of the assignment implements a way to find the LCA of two nodes in a DAG. The relevant files
for this part are 'dag.py' and 'test_DAG.py'. They are in the 'DAG_LCA' folder.


## Part 3 - [Biography Essay of an influential software engineer](https://github.com/kamilprz/CS3012/tree/master/Biography%20Essay)
I wrote my essay on Gynvael Coldwind, a Polish security and programing enthusiast who I find very inspiring. The pdf
and the .tex files can be found in the 'Biography Essay' folder.


## Part 4 - [Measuring Engineering](https://github.com/kamilprz/CS3012/tree/master/Measuring%20Engineering)
The  aim  of  this  assignment  is  to  deliver  a  report  that  considers  the  ways  in  which  thesoftware engineering process can be measured and assesed in terms of measurable data,an overview of some analytical platforms available to perform this work, the algorithmicapproaches available, and the ethical concerns surrounding this kind of analytics.

The pdf can be found in the 'Measuring Engineering' folder.
